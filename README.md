# Module 4 React
## Color Palette Generator

Welcome to my Module 4 React assignment.
In this project I was working with react for the first time. I used their documentation to create a new react app. I used functional components, JSX, state management, side-effect, styled components, imported react component and an api. 

The web-application renders a random image and extracts a color palette from the most vibrant colors in the picture. The colors also show their hex values. To get a new image, press the button.
Hope you like it!

## Usage
+ The build was used to create a live verion and is in the gitignore file.
+ Html can be found in [public/index.html](public/index.html).
+ Styles are style components written instide each component above the function.
+ All Javascript is in [src folder](src) with comments. 
> + [index.js](src/index.js) 
> + [App.js](src/App.js)
> + [ColorSwatches.js](src/ColorSwatches.js)
> + [ImagePalettePage.js](src/ImagePalettePage.js)
